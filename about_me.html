    <a href="#The Legend Of Zelda">Zelda test</a>
    <div class="Zelda">
        <p> This is just a work in progress, but im deciding if i want to add stuff about me? </p>
        <p>i wouldn't be suprised.. im so facinating and interesting!11!!1! </p>
        <p>Anyways.. Lets get started!</p>
    </div>
    <H3> Games!</H3>
    <h2 id="Zelda">The Legend Of Zelda</h2>
    <p>To start off i like..</p> <a href="https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Zeldapedia">The Legend Of Zelda! </a>
    </p>
    As you can see i like The legend of zelda games, It's been one of my favorite games when i was introduced to it as a
    kid, i originally played ocarina of time in the 3ds..(i think it was a 2ds? it didn't close it was just..
    <strong>flat and straight..</strong>)
    <p>Ocarina of time was a good game to start off, the Ocarina mechanic was just absolute <strong>CINEMA.</strong> and
        the plot was decently well, some parts did make me want to cry, don't get me wrong </p>
    <p>The plot was fun, wakng up by a fairy and then not being a normal "kid" who didn't have a fairy, then everyone
        ranting about how they have a fairy.. bla bla bla.. at first the controls were a bit wonky.. but getting used to
        them was pretty easy</p>
    <p>then you had to go and acquire a sword, then a shield..(pokemon sword and shield reference?!) then going to help
        the <a href="http://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Great_Deku_Tree">The Great Deku Tree</a></p>
    <p>then after a while he(Great Deku Tree) gives you a whole yap session about the world of hyrule and ganondorf yada
        yada.. you go find zelda and then impa teaches you <a
            href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Zelda%27s_Lullaby">Zelda's Lullaby</a> </p>
    <p>now Zelda's lullaby was an interesting song, and when meeting the princess.<i>i was always skeptic on impa being
            zelda in disguse..</i> but hey i can't prove it but surely it's a theory right?.. a <em>GAME</em> theory.
    </p>
    <!-- Milo be sure to add more things since you can't think of any rn.. lol!!-->

    <h2 id="Mask">Majora's Mask</h2>
    <div class="Majora"> </div>
    <p>For my take for <a
            href="https://zelda-archive.fandom.com/wiki/Category:The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora%27s_Mask">Majora's Mask</a>
        it was a fantastic game, (i played on the 2ds and it was the 3d
        version..)<!-- Make sure to check at home since i'm not entirely sure !-->
        I tried it out a while back and it's certianly fun, the plot is decently good.. Riding your horse exploring
        around the woods and suddenly getting <em> mugged by some monster and some fairies..</em> <br>but then the
        monsters fairy.. "tatl" gets seprated from the monster because it wanted to stop link from going after the
        monster..<br> Then getting cursed by that same monster by getting turned into some plant..?<i> in the wiki it
            says they're.."plant-based creatures.."</I> <b>so close enough i guess..</b>
        <br>There wasn't that much gameplay in the start of the whole becoming a deku shrub.. but after that a salesman
        talks about how that monster stole a mask from him(it isn't revealed that the mask is <b>STRONGLY IMPORTANT.</b>
